## Prerequisites

- [install python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.12 or higher)
- [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- make

## Start the dev server

`make`

This will set up a virtual environment, install the dependencies and run the fastApi dev server. Code changes will automatically reload
in the server. To exit, press ctrl+C. This will stop the server and deactivate the virtual environment.

On Windows, see the [Makefile](Makefile) and run the commands manually.

## Customizing the API for your facility

The reference implementation is meant to be customized for your facility's IRI implementation. Running the IRI api unmodified will show only fake, test data. The paragraphs below describe how to customize the business logic and appearance of the API for your facility.

### Customizing the business logic for your facility
The IRI API handles the "boilerplate" of setting up the rest API. It delegates to the per-facility business logic via interface definitions. These interfaces are implemented as abstract classes, one per api group (status, account, etc.). Each router directory defines a FacilityAdapter class (eg. [the status adapter](app/routers/status/facility_adapter.py)) that is expected to be implemented by the facility who is exposing an IRI API instance.

The specific implementations can be specified via the `IRI_API_ADAPTER_*` environment variables. For example the adapter for the `status` api would be given by setting `IRI_API_ADAPTER_status` to the full python module and class implementing `app.routers.status.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`. (eg. `IRI_API_ADAPTER_status=myfacility.MyFacilityStatusAdapter`)

A reference implementation that fakes every facility adapter is provided by the separate [`iri-facility-api-demo-adapter`](https://github.com/doe-iri/iri-facility-api-demo-adapter) repo, included here as a git submodule under `examples/demo-adapter`. `make dev` installs it and wires it up automatically. This repo itself ships no adapter -- it is a pure framework.

### Customizing the API meta-data
You can optionally override the [FastAPI metadata](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/), such as `name`, `description`, `terms_of_service`, etc. by providing a valid json object in the `IRI_API_PARAMS` environment variable.

If using docker (see next section), your dockerfile could extend this reference implementation via a `FROM` line and add your custom facility adapter code and init parameters in `ENV` lines.

### Environment variables

- `API_URL_ROOT`: the base url when constructing links returned by the api (eg.: https://iri.myfacility.com)
- `API_PREFIX`: the path prefix where the api is hosted. Defaults to `/`. (eg.: `/api`)
- `API_URL`: the path to the api itself. Defaults to `api/v2`.
### OpenTelemetry

The API supports OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics. Traces and metrics can be independently enabled or disabled.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch. Must be `true` for any telemetry to be emitted. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `iri-facility-api` | The `service.name` resource attribute reported to the OTLP collector. |
| `OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable trace export. Only takes effect when `OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`. |
| `OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable metric export. Only takes effect when `OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`. |
| `OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `""` | gRPC endpoint for the OTLP collector (e.g. `http://otel-collector:4317`). When empty, telemetry is printed to the console. |
| `OPENTELEMETRY_DEBUG` | `false` | Sets trace sample rate to 100% (overrides `OTEL_SAMPLE_RATE`). |
| `OTEL_SAMPLE_RATE` | `0.2` | Trace sampling rate (0.0 to 1.0). Ignored when `OPENTELEMETRY_DEBUG=true`. |
| `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` | `60000` | Metric export interval in milliseconds. |

When metrics are enabled, the FastAPI instrumentor automatically emits standard HTTP server metrics: `http.server.active_requests`, `http.server.duration`, and `http.server.response.size`.

Examples:
```bash
# Traces and metrics to an OTLP collector
OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317

# Traces only, no metrics
OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED=false

# Metrics only, no traces
OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED=false

# Debug mode: 100% sampling, console output
OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true OPENTELEMETRY_DEBUG=true
```

Links to data, created by this api, will concatenate these values producing links, eg: `https://iri.myfacility.com/my_api_prefix/my_api_url/projects/123`

- `IRI_API_PARAMS`: as described above, this is a way to customize the API meta-data
- `IRI_API_ADAPTER_*`: these values specify the business logic for the per-api-group implementation of a facility_adapter. For example: `IRI_API_ADAPTER_status=myfacility.MyFacilityStatusAdapter` would load the implementation of the `app.routers.status.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter` abstract class to handle the `status` business logic for your facility.

  The full list of router adapters and the abstract base class each must implement:

  | Variable | Mounted at | Abstract base class your adapter must subclass |
  |---|---|---|
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_facility`   | `/facility/...`   | [`app.routers.facility.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/facility/facility_adapter.py) |
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_status`     | `/status/...`     | [`app.routers.status.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/status/facility_adapter.py) |
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_account`    | `/account/...`    | [`app.routers.account.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/account/facility_adapter.py) |
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_compute`    | `/compute/...`    | [`app.routers.compute.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/compute/facility_adapter.py) |
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_filesystem` | `/filesystem/...` | [`app.routers.filesystem.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/filesystem/facility_adapter.py) |
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_storage`    | `/storage/...`    | [`app.routers.storage.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/storage/facility_adapter.py) |
  | `IRI_API_ADAPTER_task`       | `/task/...`       | [`app.routers.task.facility_adapter.FacilityAdapter`](app/routers/task/facility_adapter.py) |

  Each value is a `module.path.ClassName` string. The demo adapter's `demo_adapter.combined.DemoAdapter` (from the `examples/demo-adapter` submodule) implements all of them and is what `make dev` wires up by default. A router whose `IRI_API_ADAPTER_*` is not set is hidden from the API at startup; if `IRI_SHOW_MISSING_ROUTES=true` an unconfigured router instead fails fast at startup (the framework has no built-in fallback adapter).

- `IRI_SHOW_MISSING_ROUTES`: by default (`false`), api groups without an `IRI_API_ADAPTER_*` environment variable are silently hidden, so a facility can expose only the groups it implements. If set to `true`, an unconfigured group instead makes startup fail fast, surfacing the missing adapter as a configuration error rather than silently dropping the route.

### Facility-specific authentication

Required. Every domain whose `FacilityAdapter` extends `AuthenticatedAdapter` (`account`, `compute`, `filesystem`, `storage`, `task` -- see the base class in [`app/routers/iri_router.py`](app/routers/iri_router.py)) requires callers to send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request; `facility` and `status` are public and need no token.

This framework ships no business logic of its own for Authentication methods. Each adapter must implement:

```python
class AuthenticatedAdapter(ABC):
    async def get_current_user(self, api_key: str, client_ip: str | None) -> str:
        """Validate api_key, return the authenticated user's id (or raise)."""

    async def get_user(self, user_id: str, api_key: str, client_ip: str | None) -> User:
        """Look up name/email/etc. for the id returned by get_current_user."""
```

The demo adapter's [`DemoAuthMixin`](https://github.com/doe-iri/iri-facility-api-demo-adapter/blob/main/demo_adapter/common.py) shows the minimal shape (checks a static key, returns a fixed user). Real deployments validate against the facility trusted mechanism -- for example, NERSC and ALCF validate a Globus token in `get_current_user`.

### AmSC authentication

Optional, off by default. When enabled, `IriRouter.current_user` validates an AmSC Keycard bearer token (RIG audience-scopes it to this facility before forwarding it) *before* falling back to the facility-specific auth path above: JWKS signature/issuer/audience/expiry verification, an optional Ping userinfo freshness check, and mapping the tokens active `amsc_project_context` claim to a local facility username via a JSON file. See [`app/amsc_auth.py`](app/amsc_auth.py) for the implementation details

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AMSC_TOKEN_ENABLED` | `false` | Enabled/Disable AmSC auth. When `false`, every other `AMSC_*` variable below is ignored. |
| `AMSC_TOKEN_ISSUER` | _(required when enabled)_ | Expected `iss` claim (the AmSC Identity Provider, Ping). |
| `AMSC_TOKEN_AUDIENCE` | _(required when enabled)_ | Comma-separated list of accepted `aud` values -- this facility's RIG-scoped audience identifier(s). AmSC uses full url, like `https://api.iri.nersc.gov/`. Match is exact: a token is rejected if its `aud` contains any value outside this list, even if it also contains an accepted one -- a generic AmSC-platform token that merely lists this facility alongside other audiences is not sufficient. |
| `AMSC_TOKEN_SKIP_AUDIENCE_CHECK` | `false` | **Local-dev only -- never set in a real facility deployment.** Skips `aud` verification entirely; `AMSC_TOKEN_AUDIENCE` becomes optional while this is `true`. Exists because a local/fake IdP (e.g. RIG's Tier-1 audience-scoped exchange in a sandbox) has no real PingAM issuance path for a facility running on localhost, so it can't mint a token whose `aud` matches. Signature, issuer, expiry, `sub`, and `amsc_project_context` are still enforced. |
| `AMSC_OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` | _(unset)_ | `.well-known/openid-configuration` URL used to resolve the JWKS and userinfo endpoints. Either this needs to be provided or the explicit `AMSC_JWKS_URL` (and `AMSC_USERINFO_URL` if the userinfo check is enabled) must be set. |
| `AMSC_JWKS_URL` | _(derived from discovery)_ | Explicit JWKS endpoint, overrides the discovery endpoint. |
| `AMSC_TOKEN_ALGORITHMS` | _(derived from discovery)_ | Comma-separated list of accepted JWT signing algorithms. If unset, derived from the discovery output `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported`. Falls back to `RS256,ES256,RS384,RS512,ES384,ES512` if discovery is unset, unreachable, or has nothing usable after filtering. |
| `AMSC_TOKEN_LEEWAY_SECONDS` | `30` | Clock-skew leeway applied to `exp`/`nbf` checks. |
| `AMSC_TOKEN_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | How long JWKS keys and the discovery endpoint are cached before refetching. |
| `AMSC_USERINFO_VALIDATION_ENABLED` | `false` | When `true`, every AmSC-authenticated request also calls the userinfo endpoint (Ping) with the caller's token to catch revocation that offline JWT validation cannot see. Fail-closed: if Ping is unreachable or rejects the token, the request is denied. |
| `AMSC_USERINFO_URL` | _(derived from discovery)_ | Explicit userinfo endpoint, overrides the discovery endpoint. |
| `AMSC_USERINFO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `5` | Timeout for the discovery endpoint fetch and the userinfo call. |
| `AMSC_PROJECT_MAPPING_FILE` | _(required when enabled)_ | Path to a JSON file mapping each AmSC `amsc_project_context` this facility has provisioned to a local facility username. See [`examples/demo-adapter/amsc_project_mapping.json`](examples/demo-adapter/amsc_project_mapping.json) for the format. An `amsc_project_context` with no entry is a 401, not a silent fallback. |

Startup fails fast with a clear error if `AMSC_TOKEN_ENABLED=true` but required configuration is missing.

The default `AuthenticatedAdapter.get_current_user_amsc` resolves the mapping file; override possible on facility adapter if needed.

### Logging

Logs always go to stdout. Optionally, logs can also be written to a rotating file.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG` | Logging level for the API and adapters (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). |
| `IRI_LOG_FILE` | _(none)_ | File path for API logs. When set, logs go to both stdout and this file. |
| `LOG_FILE` | _(none)_ | Fallback file path when `IRI_LOG_FILE` is not set. |
| `IRI_LOG_ROTATION_DAYS` | `5` | Number of daily rotated log files to retain. |
| `LOG_ROTATION_DAYS` | `5` | Fallback retention when `IRI_LOG_ROTATION_DAYS` is not set. |

For local development, `make` writes logs to `runtime-logs.log` by default and keeps `5` daily rotated files. Use `make LOG_FILE=/tmp/iri-api.log`, `make IRI_LOG_FILE=/tmp/iri-api.log`, or `make LOG_ROTATION_DAYS=10` to override those defaults. You can also put the same variables in `local.env`.

## Idempotency

Compute `submit_job` and `update_job` endpoints support an optional `Idempotency-Key` request header. When provided, the server caches the first successful response for that key and returns it on any subsequent request with the same key and body — without calling the facility adapter again. This makes it safe for clients to retry on timeout without risking duplicate job submissions.

### Behaviour

| Scenario | Response |
|---|---|
| First request | Calls adapter, caches result. Response header: `Idempotency-Key-Reply: miss` |
| Retry, same body | Returns cached result. Response header: `Idempotency-Key-Reply: hit` |
| Retry, different body | `422 Unprocessable Entity` |
| Concurrent duplicate (in-flight) | `409 Conflict` with `Retry-After: 2` |
| Adapter raises | Lock released; client may retry safely |

### Backing store

The core library ships no backing store. Configure one with `IRI_IDEMPOTENCY_STORE`;
if it is unset, a request that sends `Idempotency-Key` returns `501`.

The demo adapter package provides reference stores:

| Store | Configure with | Suitable for |
|---|---|---|
| In-process dict | `IRI_IDEMPOTENCY_STORE=demo_adapter.compute.idempotency.InMemoryIdempotencyStore` | Dev / single-instance |
| Redis | `IRI_IDEMPOTENCY_STORE=demo_adapter.compute.idempotency.RedisIdempotencyStore` plus `REDIS_URL` | Multi-replica production |

For multi-replica deployments, use the Redis store. Run a local Redis instance with `make redis`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IRI_IDEMPOTENCY_STORE` | _(unset)_ | Dotted path to an idempotency store class. The demo adapter provides in-memory and Redis reference stores. |
| `REDIS_URL` | _(unset)_ | Redis connection URL (e.g. `redis://localhost:6379`) when using `RedisIdempotencyStore`. |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS` | `86400` | How long a cached response is retained after a successful call (24 hours). |
| `LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` | `60` | Maximum seconds an in-flight request holds the lock. If the IRI process crashes mid-request, the lock auto-expires after this interval so the next retry is treated as a fresh request. Set higher if your facility's scheduler API is known to be slow. |

### Quick start (dev)

```bash
make redis                          # start Redis container on :6379
# add to local.env:
export IRI_IDEMPOTENCY_STORE=demo_adapter.compute.idempotency.RedisIdempotencyStore
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
make                                # start IRI dev server
```

## Docker support

You can either use the docker images created on github.com or build the image yourself.

### Use the github docker image

Github is set up to [automatically build](.github/workflows/docker-build.yml) the latest image and push it to its registry on each commit to the `main` branch.

For now (until this repo is made public), you will have to authenticate to the github container registry with your github username and Personal Access Token (PAT) as your password:

`docker login ghcr.io -u <your username>`
(For the password, enter your PAT)

Once authenticated, you can now pull:

`docker pull ghcr.io/doe-iri/iri-facility-api-python:main`

And also run the code with the demo adapter:

`docker run -p8000:8000 -e IRI_SHOW_MISSING_ROUTES=true ghcr.io/doe-iri/iri-facility-api-python:main`

Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Build the image yourself

You can build and run the included dockerfile, for example:
`docker build -t iri . && docker run -p 8000:8000 iri`

### Using the base docker image

Rather than forking this repo, docker is recommended for running your facility implementation. For example, you could use the following example Dockerfile for your IRI api:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/doe-iri/iri-facility-api-python:main
# or: FROM registry.myfacility.gov/isg/iri/iri:main

# The "myfacility" directory contains the adapters with business logic
# specific to your IRI implementaion.
# Here we copy them into the docker image to a location that will be
# visible to the running app.
COPY ./myfacility /app/myfacility/

# Install additional libraries your implementation needs
RUN pip install additional_libraries

# Customize your image via environment variables
ENV IRI_API_ADAPTER_status="myfacility.status_adapter.StatusAdapter"
ENV IRI_API_ADAPTER_account="myfacility.account_adapter.AccountAdapter"
ENV IRI_API_ADAPTER_compute="myfacility.compute_adapter.ComputeAdapter"
ENV API_PREFIX="/myfacility/"
ENV IRI_API_PARAMS='{ \
    "title": "Facility XYZ implementation of the IRI api", \
    "terms_of_service": "https://myfacility.gov/aup", \
    "docs_url": "/", \
    "contact": { \
        "name": "My Facility Contact", \
        "url": "https://myfacility.gov/about/contact-us/" \
    } \
}'
```
